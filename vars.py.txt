⍺F # is the angular motion of the foot. ⍺F = 0 when foot is horizontal
⍺S # is the shank orientation in 3D space. ⍺S = 0 when shank is vertical
⍵S # is the angular velocity of the shank
ax,A # is the acceleration of the ankle in the x-direction
aY,A # is the acceleration of the ankle in the y-direction
Tgrav # is the torque generated by gravity
mF # is the mass of the foot
cF # is the foot’s center of mass location with respect to the ankle
TTA # is the torque generated by the tibialis anterior
d # is the lever arm of the tibialis anterior at the ankle. d = 0.037
FTA # is the muscle force of the tibialis anterior. FTA = FCE + FPE + FPD 
FPE # is the parallel elastic force
FPD # is the parallel damping element force
FCE # is the force in the contractile element. FCE = Fiso,max* fad* ftl* ffv
fad # is the activation level. 0 ≤ fad ≤ 1
muscle_excitation # is the muscle excitation. 0 ≤ muscle_excitation  ≤ 1
Tact # is the time constant for activation. Tact = 0.04s
Tdeact # is the time constant for deactivation. Tdeact = 0.04s
lMT # is the length of the muscle-tendon complex for the tibialis anterior. lMT = lMT,0 - dankle*Ф
lMT,0 # is the rest length.  lMT,0 = 0.381
Ф # is the current relative angle at the foot. Ф :=  ⍺S - ⍺F. Ф = 0 when there is a right angle at the ankle
lT # is the tendon length constant. lT = 0.317
lCE # is the length of the contractile element. lCE = lMT - lT  
VCE # is the contraction speed of the muscle. VCE =  - dankle*Ф (*** the phi has a lil dot on him but idk how to draw it)
ffl # is the force-length factor. ffl = 
ICE, opt # is the fiber length at which the optimum force can be generated. ICE, opt = 0.082
W # is the width parameter describing the overlapping of filaments in the sarcomere. W = 0.56
ffv # is the force-velocity factor. It models the dependency of the muscle force on the contraction speed of the muscle. ffv =  if vCE  > 0 (extension).  ffv = else (contraction)
gmax = 10
LCE, opt = 0.82
